The chart above clearly demonstrates the total number of fans followers paying close attention to the Microblog of entertainment stars from 2017 to 2018. In 2017, the number was at a low level of 12.8 billion, while within one year, it reached 16.7 billion, a rise of 3.9 billion.Undoubtedly, the diagram demonstrates the social phenomenon of idol worship, which is prevalent among teenagers nowadays. Briefly speaking, young people are inclined to idolize those who excel in appearance or talent. For instance, Su Bingtian represents the image of a sports hero, whose handsome appearance and unparalleled skills are passionately adored by his sports fans. By contrast, several teenage boys and girls win their fame overnight in a great many contests on TV, which provokes noisy nationwide debates on the value and harm of admiring these idols.
In my opinion, idolatry is a double-edged sword which can exert a profound influence for either good or bad on the growth of young people. If we simply worship them by imitating their hairstyle or pursuing fashions unreasonably, the obsession will certainly waste a great deal of our time and money, endangering the efficiency of our study or work. On the contrary, if we endeavor to improve ourselves by bridging the gap between our role models and ourselves, we will lead a positive and fruitful life. Accordingly, the latter attitude should be adopted to direct our way of life.

① They are in the spotlight, renowned or notorious; they are the topic of ordinary people who like to know everything about them. 他们身处聚光灯下，或声名显赫，或臭名昭著；他们是那些想要了解一切的普通人口中的谈资。
② Since film stars and pop singers are newsworthy figures, and their stories draw far more attention than those of other people, it is natural that the press tries to attract readers to buy their magazines by featuring private lives of famous people. 由于电影明星和流行歌手是有新闻报道价值的人物，他们的事情比其他人能吸引更多的关注，因此新闻界自然努力吸引读者购买以报道名人私生活为特色的杂志。
