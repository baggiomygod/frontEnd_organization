某高校学生创业原因调查


From the information given in the pie chart, we can see the survey on the reasons for starting one's own business among college students in a certain university. Those whose ideals are to become entrepreneurs account for 44%, the biggest among all the five categories, while those who could not find suitable jobs account for 15%. Increasingly, it has become common for university students to start their own businesses prior to graduation.As long as they are cautious, this kind of real-world experience can greatly benefit their future careers. Above all, students who launch their own businesses can gain valuable insight into their future career path. Some students may even choose to switch majors as a result of insight gained from entrepreneurial activities. In addition, regardless of whether a student succeeds or fails in a business venture, the mere fact of having work experience will come in handy when seeking a full-time job after graduation. Employers will regard these students as more ambitious, hard-working and mature than graduates who lack such work experience.Despite the benefits to students of “getting their feet wet” in the business world, it is crucial that they maintain academic studies as a top priority. Every student must decide how best to allocate his or her time outside of class. For those with a manageable schedule, exploratory mind and entrepreneurial spirit, work experience prior to graduation can offer important career benefits.

① As long as starting a business allows students to continue their studies, it could provide some valuable experience. 只要创业允许学生继续完成他们的学业，它就能为学生提供宝贵的经验。
② Starting a business while at college will create a conflict of priorities between studying and running the business. 在校期间创业，学业与经营企业之间会产生矛盾，需要权衡二者孰轻孰重。
③ Starting a business that is related to a student's major could have some benefits. 学生的创业如果与所学专业相关，那么创业是有一些益处的。
