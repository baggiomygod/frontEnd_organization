The column chart above clearly reflects the number of hours students spent in studying per day in a certain primary school between 2010 and 2019. From 2010 to 2013, the figure climbed gradually from 6.5 to 7, a rise of merely 0.5. It jumped markedly from 7 to 10 between 2013 and 2019.For the majority of people, stress is a fact of life. As an illustration, school time can be a period of constant pressure for students. Factors like upcoming examinations and endless assignments can exert a strong influence on young people's mental health. Primary school students, who have to juggle daily courses, homework and frequent exams, are particularly susceptible to pressure.In my opinion, by maintaining a healthy lifestyle, keeping an organized calendar and knowing when to relax, people can successfully manage and reduce their stress. To begin with, the most fundamental way that we can mitigate stress is to maintain a healthy lifestyle, which includes adequate sleep, proper exercise and a balanced diet. In addition, people need to relax by watching movies, listening to music, reading a magazine, or chatting with friends, etc.
