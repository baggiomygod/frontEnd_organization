2010年第一季度-2011年第二季度中国网页游戏市场规模

The column chart above reveals the market size of web games in China from the first quarter of 2010 to the second quarter of 2011. During the period of one and a half years, there has been a sudden jump in market size from 520 million yuan to 820 million yuan, a rise of 300 million yuan, at a year-on-year growth rate of more than 50%.When computers' entertaining function is highly spoken of, such a problem does deserve our serious concern. First and foremost, the most serious harm of web games comes from their contents, which greatly affect children's mental health. The majority of games involve violence, such as fighting and killing. To win or kill their opponents, children are permitted to use various tools like guns, knives and bombs. When they are enjoying the pleasure of success, a violent turn of mind is developed and rooted in them, which may induce future violent behavior in their real life. What is more, being indulged in web games also does harm to children's physical health. The radiation from the computer can result in many uncomfortable feelings, such as headache, poor eyesight and dizziness. Being lack of sleep and skipping meals, children are more inclined to get irritable and suffer from severe malnutrition.Of course, it is not the end of the story. Being indulged in web games also affects children's study and their communication with others. All these facts indicate that our society should strengthen the regulation of web games.
