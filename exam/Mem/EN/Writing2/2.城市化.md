The chart above clearly reveals the degree of urbani-zation in China during the past 40 years. From 1980 to 2010, it jumped markedly from 19.39% to 49.95%, a rise of approximately 30%. The percentage increased steadily from 49.95% to 63.89% between 2010 and 2020, a rise of nearly 14%.It goes without saying that remarkable achievements have been made in China's urbanization since the reform and opening-up in the past few decades. First and foremost, the fundamental contributor for such a sharp increase in urban population results from China's economic prosperity. Furthermore, urbanization has created ample job opportunities for ordinary people, especially for those migrant workers who move to urban areas. More importantly, the authorities concerned have substantially increased infrastructure facilities in urban areas, such as recreational parks and cultural centers, to satisfy the requirements of urban dwellers.Even so, it is also worth mentioning that as people in mounting numbers enjoy the prosperity of modern cities, we cannot ignore the increasing challenges urbanization has posed to natural resources, the environment, job market and public services.
