As is clearly demonstrated by the pie chart, the author is trying to interpret the ratio of the reasons why the citizens in a certain city choose to purchase new energy cars. It can be seen that the number of citizens who select new energy cars because there is no limitation for them to obtain a plate for their new car accounts for the largest proportion with the value of 50%, followed by the reason of government subsidy, which takes up 30%, with the purpose of environmental protection making up 20%.

What can be easily deduced from the chart is that compared with the traditional cars which consume fossil fuels, the new energy cars have many advantages at present, which make them of great competitiveness and popularity among the citizens. First of all, with the number of private cars becoming increasingly large and the city growing more and more crowded, the citizens buying traditional private cars have to wait for a long time to get the qualification to own a plate from the government. Consequently, for those who would like to overcome the limitation, the new energy cars are their perfect alternative. Besides, the current subsidy from the government is so fat that most of the new energy cars can be purchased at a relatively low price.However, just as a coin has two sides, the new energy cars also have some disadvantages. For example, most of the new energy cars have to be charged for a relatively long time and they can only travel a short distance, which limits their application in distant travel.

From what has been analyzed above, we can easily come to the conclusion that the new energy cars will become increasingly popular in the following years with their current disadvantages solved.
