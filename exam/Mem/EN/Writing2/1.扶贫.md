The diagram above clearly reflects that China has made tremendous achievements in poverty alleviation from 2012 to 2020. During this period, China's impoverished rural population decreased considerably from nearly 100 million to nearly zero, a decline of 100 million. At the same time, the poverty headcount ratio also fell from approximately 10% to almost 0%.Several primary factors that account for the above-mentioned changes could be summarized as follows. To begin with, the authorities concerned in China have adopted a combination of conventional and innovative approaches, which have helped improve rural education and healthcare. What is more, our country has put great emphasis on infrastructure establishment in poor rural areas, which has effectively bridged the gap between the rich and the poor. Last but not least, the achievements are attributed to China's speedy economic development during the past several decades.In short, China's poverty alleviation campaign is particularly vital, both nationally and internationally. First of all, anti-poverty achievements allow more people to enjoy the advantages of its economic boom. In addition, the Chinese government has fulfilled its promise of lifting all people out of poverty.
