Directions:Suppose Professor Smith asked you to plan a debate on the theme of city traffic. Write him an e-mail to

1) suggest a specific topic with your reasons, and
2) tell him about your arrangements.

Dear Prof.Smith,
  I am writing to express __my plan of the debate on the theme of city traffic what you entrust me a few days ago__. I think the debate theme should be named "Drive to work and take public transport which is better for citizens".My reasons are as follow.
  Now days many people take public transport to work even if them have private car, at the same time,others only drive to work. Why dose this happen and which is better for citizens, different student have different opinions. If you agree with me, I will divide the whole class into two groups accoeding to their opinion, and the debate will be held in a month.
  Thank you very much for taking time from your busy schedule to read my letter. If you have any comments, please let me know.I'm looking forward to hearing from you.


  Dear Professor Smith,

This email comes to you from a student named Li Ming. I am writing this email to you to extend my suggestions and plans on a debate on the theme of city traffic.

The details, such as the topic of it, and my arrangements about this debate can be listed as follows. Initially, as for the topic, we may focus on "Bicycle sharing". Here are the reasons. On one hand, bicycle sharing makes it very convenient for people to travel, and the price of one trip is very low, which every one can afford. On the other hand, its management is not perfect. Even kids can open the lock and ride the bicycle, and no one can deny the fact that such behaviors is very dangerous. Finally, the debate will discuss whether bicycle sharing is a blessing or a curse. Participants can be divided into two groups to present their views alternatively.

Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to reading this email. It is my sincerely hope that I could contribute more to this debate. I'm Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely，

Li Ming
