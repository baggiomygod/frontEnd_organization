## Directions: Write an email to a group of international students, and introduce one of the most famous Chinese celebrities.

（一）预测范文
Dear Friends,I am writing the email to introduce one of the most prestigious Chinese celebrities to you, Confucius.Being a great thinker, educator and founder of Confucianism, Confucius is an ancient sage during the Spring and Autumn Period. His words and life story were recorded by his disciples and their students in The Analects. As an enduring classic of Chinese culture, The Analects has influenced all thinkers, writers and politicians in the over-2,000-year-long history of China since Confucius. No scholar could truly understand this long-standing culture or the inner world of the ancient Chinese without this book.Much of Confucian thought on Heaven and Man represents universal human values. This is perhaps why Confucian thought in the 21st century still remains the interest of not only the Chinese people but also people in other parts of the world.
Yours sincerely,Li Ming

（五）经典句型
① Mosaic cultures are part of the universal heritage of humanity and they are powerful means of bringing together diverse peoples and social groups. 多元文化作为全球人类遗产的一部分，是将不同民族和社会群体融合的有力方式。
② For China, like any other rapidly developing countries, there is a danger that age-old customs and traditions may become lost in the shadows of modernization. 和其他快速发展的国家一样，在中国，古老的习俗和传统在现代化的影响下面临着消失的危险。
③ If kung fu, Peking Opera or Swan Lake ever perished from the earth, it would be a tragedy of immeasurable proportions. 如果功夫、京剧或《天鹅湖》芭蕾舞剧从地球上消失，那将是人类不可估量的损失。
