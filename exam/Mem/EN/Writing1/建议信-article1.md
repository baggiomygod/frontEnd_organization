 # Write an email to your university to suggest setting network cables in students' dormitories.


 To Whom It May Concern,
 
 As a student of our university, I should first commend you for the additional computers that you have recently added to the computer rooms. I am writing to you to request that the Internet be installed in the dormitories.As you know, the Internet has become an increasingly important tool at university. Not only do professors require students to use it for research, but much communication is done between professors and students through email as well. In addition, some professors are beginning to post their lecture notes online for students to review in their spare time.While there are a few computer labs with Internet access throughout our campus, with over 20,000 students living in the dorms, there is a great need for more Internet access areas.Thank you for your time.
                                
                                Yours sincerely,Li Ming

（四）“道长”点评
建议信首段应表明写作意图，简要介绍自己，注意语气，切勿啰嗦。次段应针对情况提出具体建议或忠告，首先肯定优点，再写改进内容，否则对方会以为是投诉信而非建议信。尾段应总结建议，注意礼貌原则。建议信很容易写成议论文，应时刻考虑读者的感受，所以给对方提建议时经常提到I和you。
（五）经典句型
