## Directions: Write a letter to a friend of yours to recommend one of your favorite movies, and give reasons for your recommendation.

Dear Michael,

As one of your closest friends, I'm writing the letter in purpose of recommending one of my favorite movies to you, Around the World in Eighty Days.The primary factors for my recommendation are as follows. 

For one thing, it is a movie of science fiction which tells us an exciting story about an English gentleman, Mr. Phileas Fogg, who makes a bet with his clubmates and managers to travel around the world in eighty days. For another, it gives us a vivid description of the difficulties and incidents which happen in his journey.Wish you enjoy the movie. Looking forward to your reply.


                  Yours sincerely,Li Ming
