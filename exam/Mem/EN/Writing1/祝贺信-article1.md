## Directions: Write an email to one of your friends, Zhang Wuji, to congratulate him on graduation.

Dear Wuji,

Congratulations upon having received your Master in Computer Science from ZheJiang University. I know this has meant years of study and hard work on your part, and it is an achievement you can well be proud of.

I have followed your progress with pleasure and interest for many years. I am sure, from the fine record you have made, that you will be a success in whatever you undertake. No doubt you are tired after the strain of the past few months, and if you would like to come to my hometown for a few weeks this summer, we'd be very happy to have you.I'd certainly enjoy hearing about your plans, now that you have completed your college course. Think it over, and let me know.

Yours faithfully,Li Ming
