## Directions: You are arranging a dinner party. Write a letter to your friends separately, and invite him or her to the party. Give the necessary details and explain why you are holding it

Dear George,

How are you? I haven't seen you for a while. Hope all is well. Anyway, I'm writing because I want to invite some friends over for dinner and I think you'd like to join us.

The dinner will be at my place, next Friday at 7 o'clock. I will do the cooking and provide the wine. I've enclosed a map of how to get to my new apartment. It's a little out of the way, I'm afraid, but we've got a spare room and you're welcome to stay the night if you wish.Anyway, do let me know if you can make it. My new number is at the top of the page, so you can give me a call sometime. Take care and see you soon.
Yours,Li Ming
