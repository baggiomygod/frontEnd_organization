## You have recently returned from a trip. However, you were dissatisfied with the service you received at the hotel where you were visiting.
##### Write a letter to the manager of the hotel. Give details of when you stayed, explain why you were unhappy with the service and say what you'd like to be done about it.


Dear Sir or Madam,I write to express my dissatisfaction with the service I received while staying at your hotel during my vacation between the 2nd and 11th of April this year.Although your hotel is rated as a five-star one, I found that the rooms were not cleaned on a daily basis, and that my bed was cleaned up only every three days. In addition, the food in the restaurant was similarly disappointing. Not only was it extremely overpriced, but the quality was very poor. I was therefore forced to eat out in the local restaurants.I trust you will take my complaints seriously, and make every effort to improve your service in the future. I would greatly appreciate a discount on my bill (receipt enclosed). I look forward to a favorable reply at your earliest convenience.
Yours sincerely,Li Ming

尊敬的先生或女士：
今年4月2日至11日的假期期间我曾住在贵饭店。我写信是为了表达对贵饭店服务的不满。
尽管贵饭店被评为五星级饭店，但我发现客房并非每天都有人打扫，我的床每三天才被整理一次。此外，餐厅的食物也同样令人失望，不但价格过高，而且质量很差。因此我被迫外出在当地餐馆就餐。
我相信您会认真对待我的投诉，并会在将来尽力改善饭店的服务。您若给我的账单打个折扣（附上收据），我将非常感谢。期待您得便时尽早给我圆满的答复。
您真诚的，李明
