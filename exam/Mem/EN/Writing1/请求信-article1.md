As you know, I have laid a solid foundation in religious studies. I would be grateful if, in the letter, you would confirm that I have adequate qualifications to attend the course.Would you be so kind as to give a brief introduction to my academic performance during my undergraduate studies, especially that under your supervision?

（四）“道长”点评
请求信是对收信人提出请求，希望对方满足该请求。请求信与询问信均为向对方提出某种要求并请对方给予答复，区别在于请求信的核心是请求他人做某事及其原因，重点是写清为何提出请求，避免为收信人带来麻烦。
