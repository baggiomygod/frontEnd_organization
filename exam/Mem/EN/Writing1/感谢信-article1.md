## Directions: Write to one of your friends, Wang Lei, to express your thanks to his warm reception.

Dear Wang Lei,
  Thank you very much for those five wonderful days at your house! Every moment was a delight. I can't remember ever having enjoyed myself so thoroughly elsewhere.This is to tell you again how much I enjoyed the weekend in Hangzhou. 
  
  Everything was just perfect: the weather, your company, the beautiful surroundings—no wonder I'm finding it difficult to get down to reading this morning! The classroom life seems so dull and prosaic compared to the days in Hangzhou.I hope you know how much I appreciate your hospitality and your thoughtful kindness to me. I count myself fortunate indeed to have such a generous and charming friend as you. I hope something will bring you to Beijing soon so that I can reciprocate your great kindness.

                  Yours sincerely,Li Ming
